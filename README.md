Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a highly experienced Full Stack Developer, with more than 4 years of experience. I previously 
held the position of Senior Civil Engineer where I have held and managed technical teams and 
have held senior level technical roles in Globally recognized Corporations such as La Vista 
Developments, architecting and designing Infrastructure Systems creating highly complex 
Enterprise level infrastructural solutions. 

I am seeking opportunities where I can bring the depth and strength of my experience to help 
drive the implementation and support of technically complex infrastructures for large scale 
corporations in web development.

I currently live in Egypt with my family and my intention is to relocate to Trabzon permanently. 
Currently in my role as a Full Stack Developer, I have crowned my skills in various programming 
languages and frameworks such as JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and React. I am particularly adept at 
developing scalable and efficient software solutions that drive business growth. My recent 
achievements include leading, designing and developing a Web Application. I am excited about the 
opportunity to bring my unique blend of technical skills and leadership experience to your dynamic 
team.

Prior, as a project manager, I was managing a full technical Technology team for Ras Al Khaimah 
Municipality Department that provides Structural Engineering solutions for one of the largest 
Emirate states. My role was to revise permits, check for regulations, and provide consultations to 
large scale corporations. 

I would welcome consideration for available role within your organization where you feel my broad 
knowledge and strength can add value to your business. I am a keen technologist with a passion for 
continuous learning. 

Thank you for your consideration, 
Regards
